# Being a Winner (Winnerism)

This article is not a rehash of any particular psychological doctrine, just the observances of a humble scholar loose in the big bad world. Wheather you travel, conduct business, or stay cooped up in your room (fwiw that's not the lifestyle of a winner) only to emerge for the life's bare necesseties, you come across personality types of all kinds. Taking a glance across the crowded room (a coffee shop in Spain) I see very few people who look like **winners**. I guess society taught them well.

Being a winner is more than slapping on some nice threads and a smile, it's about projection; the energy that we project onto the world.

This energy is evident in the way we:

* Talk
* Hold ourselves (posture)
* Interact with others

When we witness someone who exudes this energy we are aware of something fundamentally and indefinably *correct* about their appearance. It's impressive and effortless. 

There are a few different types of winner; the neieve (try-hard) winner, the compeditor, and the natural.

The try-hard projects a false, bloated image of themselves ontop the world in the hopes that someone, in all their igonrance, will be fooled by him and love him. These people tals a lot with little substance.

The compeditor derives his self image through the subjugation of others. He is capable and resourceful, and is often found in upper middle-management positions, but no-one loves him and he is alone. He is an existentialist living alone on an island of his own design.

The natural derives his confidence though his relationships and connection with those around him. He is the leader and the entrepreneur. He is driven by love, and is the one to put your faith/mnoney on.

Being the Natural doesn't mean you have to be born with it, it just means you have your priorities sorted out, and have let go of negative attitudes that stem from the shortcomings in your psychological/physiological makeup.

The difficult thing for us humans is to break old habits. Given enough time we always seem to revert to what we know best, even thoughit's not very good for us. The trick to being a winner is to reset these default patterns by becoming addicted to the things which make us a winner.

* Relationships. The measure of a mas can indeed be judged by the quality of his relationships. Showing love and caring for others is vital.
* Asserticeness. A wise man one said told me that the most powerful word in business in "no". Learn how to use it effectively.
* Posture. A winner holds himself upright with shoulders back, ready to embrace the world. Strengthen the spine abd enpower the mind.
* Purpose. Most important, and the key to all of the above points. Very few people have a purpose in life, so if you haven't found yours yet, then your purpose should be to find it. Remember that purpose is not a goal; it's not selfish, it can only exist for the greater good. When you're aligned with your purpose, it's a force that overrides all others.


The failure of the education system to impart these essential qualities on young people never ceases to amaze me. Only though proper mentorshio or certain life preconditions will they understand the importance and relevance of self e powerment. Remember that knowlegde is better shared.
