# Economic Decline and Collapse

All capitalist economies at some point or another experience the inevitable decay of economic decline, usually as a result of widespread corruption or mismanagement of funds within the government and banking systems. 

This phoenomenon is most keenly felt by members of the prolitariat who live from week to week on a paycheck, and rely on the wellbeing of the economy for employment and to keep interest rates and inflation minimal.

The term "economic collapse" has been used to describe a broad range of bad economic conditions, ranging from a severe, prolonged depression with high bankruptcy rates and high unemployment (such as the Great Depression of the 1930s), to a breakdown in normal commerce caused by hyperinflation (such as in Weimar Germany in the 1920s), or even an economically caused sharp increase in the death rate and perhaps even a decline in population (such as in countries of the former USSR in the 1990s).

A total economic collapse can be triggered may be triggered by various events, such as a financial crisis, an external trade shock, an adverse supply shock or the bursting of an economic bubble, and may be also brought about suddenly by way of a natural disaster or epidemic.

An economic collapse is often accompanied by social chaos, civil unrest and sometimes a breakdown of law and order resulting an total anarchy. (examples)

## Stages of Decline

The process of economic decay as observed throughout history is brought about by the less favourable aspects of human nature. 

1. In a strong economy everyone lives in abundance, goods are readily available, and life is good. Unfortunately, as is human nature, we become accustomed to these luxuries and complacency and a sense of entitlement sets in. People at all levels of society start to take advantage of how good things are:

    * Banks lend money that will never be returned (american fiasco)
    * Construction contracts cuttuption (philippines, china ghost cities)
    * Abuse of social welfare programs (austrlalia)
    * Millitary overspending (americs)

2. Thus the economy is sent into a steady decline as inflation rises. Unemployment rises and reliance on social wellfare increases. Bubbles in the economy caused by government overspending and bank overlending begin to emerge, and a eventually a recession bomes inevitable. The banks begin printing more money as a short-term solution, further devaluing the currency, and inflation becomes hyperinflation with devistating long-term consequences.

3. The recession leaves a large portion of the popolation jobless and homeless, and businesses fail at alarming rates. Infrastructure begins to decay due to reprioritisation and lack of government funds. The power grid becomes unstable and rolling blackouts are a daily occurrence. It's do or die for the working class, and large scale civil unrest and riots become the norm. 

Fearing that the banks will become insolvent, people panick and withdraw their deposits en masse causing a "bank run". 
As a bank run progresses, it generates its own kind of momentum that sends the economic collapse into overdrive, with the likelihood of default increasing as more people withdraw their deposits. This can destabilize a bank to the point of facing sudden bankruptcy. At this point a bank must either default (great depression, 10c on the dollar), or be bailed out (american bank bailout). The common parctice is for the government to "borrow" money to compensate for the financial crisis, incurring further debt and political inter-dependency (see the political assassing doco for more info).

4. In the event of a total collapse, infrasstructure grinds to a complete halt and there are no more deliveries to fill the supermarket shelves. There is a rush for supplies and everything goes within in a matter of hours. Those who have hoarded goods or gasoline now offer them at exorbitant prices, and those who can't afford them turn to valdalism and violence in order to survive. Total lawlessness ensues and urban areas become warzones controlled by gangs.

5. The government implements martial law, and clashes break out between civilian malitia and government forces. The government now controls the supply of food and water, and severe poverty and starvation become a common sight. Those who have no means of providing for themselves have no choice but to accept the government's totalitarian regime.

The government implements martial law. Fighting between civilians and government forces break out nationwide. Maintaining more than a 30 day supply of food is considered hoarding food and is illegal. Severe poverty and starvation become a common sight. The government offers marginally acceptable food, water and shelter in exchange for your Freedom, Liberty, and Independence. Democracy ends and a Socialist form of government takes over under the guise of fixing society’s problems with the false promise that peace and prosperity will return better than it was just a few years ago. A Totalitarian regime assumes power and the individual freedoms and liberties once enjoyed by the people are completely eliminated.

The final step in an unchecked economic collapse is a military takeover (militirisation) of the country, with the creation of (mass) camps to house those who can't fend for themselves. Under this kind of reigeme all individual freedoms and liberty have been lost.

Banks and businesses fail at ever increasing rates. Nobody seems to have any money. Many are now homeless. Labor unions instigate strikes, civil unrest, and large scale riots. Government services are interrupted and unreliable. Local and national infrastructure is in decay. Violent gangs begin to appear and assert themselves. The government begins confiscation of firearms from law abiding citizens. Violence is everywhere. Cities and urban areas become very dangerous places to live.

What used to be well manicured middle class neighborhoods are filled with the carcasses of empty houses damaged and destroyed by vandals. The nation’s infrastructure has been seriously neglected and is in need of a major overhaul. The power grid becomes unreliable. Rolling blackouts are a daily occurrence. You can no longer buy or sell gold or own foreign currency. Inflation is out of control. Now the economy collapses. There is a rush for everything and the shelves go empty in a matter of hours. Society falls into chaos. The control of urban areas shifts when violent gangs takeover control of the streets and urban neighborhoods. The government issues restrictive measures in an attempt to control the economy. Everything is in short supply and heavily rationed. Food and gasoline is very expensive and there are very long lines to get them when they are available. Affordable quality health care is non-existent and your job is a distant memory. You will do without what you are unable to provide for yourself. You will discover what it is to live in a third world country.

/*
 Unemployment is on the rise. Ever increasing numbers of people receive government assistance in one form or another. People are paid not to work. Government spending has increased dramatically. The price of gold, silver, and other precious metals rise to prices unheard of just a few years earlier. Inflation reaches the double digit levels.

/*
The affects of decline can be observed in a healthy economy, with the onset of complacency among the working class, and corruption among the bankers and government.

Abuse of social walfare and bank lending puts strain on the economy, causing a bubble? which forces interest rates to rise, and development to slow due to reduced/tighter lending. 

As a result the government prints more money causing inflation, and in some cases hyperinflation. (examples)

The effects are felt most drastically among the members of the proletariate as unemployment rises and civil unrest ensues. 

When unemployment reaches 25% the cuntry is in a dire state, and extreme measures  ...

An economic meltdown if further worsened when asset holders hurredly withdraw their assets in whats known as a "bank pull". This happened in the Great Depression of 1938. For further reading see how xxx narrowly averted disaster in the xxx by bailing out the banks from the national treasury.

The next step of course if complete military takeover. Dictatorship under the guise of socialist reigeme

There are of course many factors that may accelerate a total economic collpse, which are [detailed below]().




Despite philosophical progressivism over the ages, the bourgeoisie social class (haute and petite) became reactionary in their refusal to allow the ascension (economic, social, political) of people from the proletariat (peasants and urban workers) in order to maintain hegemony.

## The New Generation

Danegerous times lie ahead, and the issue is social. While the world governments desperately play the forex in a bid to keep the outlook looking peachy from the outside in, the youth of today (millenials) are growing up in a state of totlal disillusionment. While may be nothing new, with stakes are higher than ever before. 

For the most part, children of the previous generation grew up with strong morals values instilled by their family and the society around them. Small business owners took pride in their work, people exchanged and bartered at markets, and life was good. Now we have mass corporitisation and poverty breeding contempt and hate for the world in young minds, and thanks to modern technology and communications the perception of this relaity is no longer isolated to the individual or the immediate community. It's small wonder young people turn away from the world and immerse themselves in technology, passive entertainments and destructive behaviour. After all, what is there to look forward too? A job at maccas and a crippling morgage in 10 years time? Please, young people need something to believe in.

## Fixing the Numbers

It's the job of governmential economists to make the economy look good on paper, as it aids the federal budget, and bolsters public oppinion by reflecting the success of their government's policies and reforms.

In light of the statistical slights-of-hand the government employs to doctor their figures, it's necessary to seek alternative sources of information for guaging the state of the economy. Here are a few:

* rate of inflation
* average disposable income and cost of living
* interest rates
* state of healthcare and social wellfare
* unemployment rate among the proletariate
* percentage of uni graduates unable to find work

/*
Therefore, alternative statistics are far more informative when it comes to gauging the state of an economy

The government plays many games to mast the true state of affairs affecting their economy. For instance

, and their suggested policies are designed and implemented with this sole purpose in mind. 

It's all about numbers and figures, so the information that's provided in these financial reports cannot be deemed to be representative of the true state of the nation.

seem like an inevitability and at the very least, our standard of living is going to progressively deteriorate, especially 

The indulgence in statistical slights-of-hand the government

## Preparing for a Total Collapse

Our fragile society comprises of so many complex moving parts, and it's both frightening and necessary to understand that at any given moment we are only three square meals away from total anarchy.

An economic collapse may be slow build-up and a culmination of many deciding factors, or it could be a sudden disaster that effectively shuts down the entire system, such as:

*
*

In the event of a total economic collapse the process will be roughly as follows:

1.
2.

The skills that are deemed to be important in our modern world will cease to be relevant, and a much more practical set of survival skills and preparedness will be required. 

* Link to Survivalism

It is therefore prudent to educate and prepare yourself for such events in the event that such disasters may come to pass.
