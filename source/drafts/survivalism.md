# Surviving Technology

The evolution of technology carries with it certain consequences for us as a species.

Physical and cognitive functions that were once imperative to our survival are no longer required, and have been replaced by reliance on technology, to the point where some parts of the world are already looking like a scene from the space resort in Wall-E.

So what happens when practical skills like memory, intuition, fitness and so fourth are no longer valued? …

The further our society departs from nature, the very source that gives us life, the weaker and more reliant we become, the more susceptible to disease, and the less likely to survive.

If your world revolves around computers and electronic devices, then you should seriously give some thought to how life would be without it. How would you survive?

Most people thing that the government has their backs in a time of emergency, but it’s just not the case.

In Australia we import most of the food we should be growing ourselves because of trade agreements. If the deliveries stop, and the trucks stop filling the supermarkets, then we are only three square meals from total anarchy. Scary though, isn’t it?

This article isn’t to scare people, it’s a wake-up call to empower people to change their own lives and those they love, because no-one else will do it for you.

Rather than frittering your time on Facebook, go buy some seeds and get your hands dirty building a garden. Instead of reading up on the next funky Apple device, try reading a book on how to survive in the wilderness, then go do it!

There’s nothing wrong with hoping for the best, but always plan for the worst. Life is good, so go live it!

Ask yourself, what would you do if the grid stopped functioning.

* Where would you get food?
* Where would you go?
* How would you be self-sufficient?
* How would you protect yourself and your loved ones?
* Do you have the practical skills to rebuild after a collapse?

If you answered even one of those questions in the positive, then you're doing better than most.

## Food

Int he case of a total system collapse, on of the first things to stop will be supermarket deliveries. In Australia ... trade agreements ...
Three square emans from anarchy ...

Store enough food for your immediate group to survive for a minimum of three months. Brown rice(storage, survival suration?) is a safe bet, as well as long life canned food and astronout/army meals. Also keep some salt, and a water filter with enough replacable elements to keep you out of trouble.

You won'twant to live on rice forever, so your aim will be to setup, or have access to, a garden as soon as possible.

It's a good idea to keep enough seeds to start a garden of your own, or if you get caught out then find a produce farm as soon as possible ad offer your servbices. Farm will fast become the most important places on the planet, and will be in need of extra staff to meet the extra demand, and security from looters.
