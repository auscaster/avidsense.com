## On Developer Friendliness

No, this is not a blog about being nice to your fellow developer, which I'm sure you all are anyway. 
It's about the state of startups that are saturating the market today.

If you're anything like us, of of the first things you look at when evaluating a new startup is "developer friendliness".
The reason for this, is that software developemnt is both time intensive and costly, therefore projects that are developer focused usually have it where it counts.
These projects are usually a labour of love, sometimes squillions of dollars, 
but either way its a whole lot better than some get rich quick scheme dreamed up by ye old internet marketing gugu.

The advntage a good creative deleloper mentality has, and why they are so important to every startup, 
is their ability to conceptualise and implement complex workflows and patters.

Take Gitbug for example. This is not some horing corporate entity, this is a group of dedicated individuals who love what they do! 
Sure, they've had their issues, but they hold themselves personally accountable because their livelyhood is on the line.
At the end of the day, this is the kind of person/business that I trust with my data, (not the type that throws money at an issue and expects it to be solved)
not some corporate clock-watching desk monkey trying to scrape by doing the bare minimum so he can get in his afternoon game of solataire.

Next time you're evaluating a startup, check the things that count: Strong APIs, SDKs, unique and original design, and open source!


# WebRTC to the Rescue

If a perfect world, WebRTC would solve all our problems relating to Internet video streaming and p2p connections. 
Unfortunately though, our world is far from perfect ;)

To a certain extent, WebRTC does acheive this, 
but the inability of the big players to unanimously decide on a video codec means that browser support is fractured... farmiliar tune right?

At this stage, if you want to take advantage of then your users need to be using either Firefox or Chrome. 
That's a pretty big ask for a startup, 
but fortunately more and more startups are saying, "to hell with these stuffy beurocrats, we want the technology". 
This is a stance to be applauded, and as far as I'm concerned a "selling point" for these startups - it shows they are thinking right.

Cisco?

In the mean time, there is a workaround which enables you to acheive video streaming on all browsers, and it's called Symple. 
Symple is a minimal p2p messaging protocol which includes a player model that automatically detects the best streaming method to be used for the browser being used.
We built the Symple media library out of srustration with the state of internet streaming.

Lets the companies that control the internet can resolve their issues and Internet video can take the forward step promised, 
and as yet undelevered by WebRTC.
