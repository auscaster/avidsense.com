A battle rages between the people and the powers that be, and the steaks are our very freedom and human dignity. We live at a crucial turning point in mankind's history, and the outlook is grim but not hopeless. Apathy and cynicism are the new swag, and every subversive move made by the encroaching dark hand of control is passed off under the guise of utilitarian action<!-- masked as a utilitarian ethics -->, but one must never doubt the resilience of the human spirit when faced with true adversity.

This intent of this article is not to spread fear and panic, rather to provide a parctical reference to surviving the climactic state of affairs faced by the new generation. Lets face it, the people who run the show would do ANYTHING to maintain the balance of power, and the world can only hope that YOU feel as passionately about your freedoms as they do about control.

Our fragile society is comprised of so many complex moving parts, which at any point could come crumbling down around our ears. Very few people are ready for such an occurrence, and it's both frightening and necessary to understand that at any given moment we are only three square meals away from total anarchy.

## What to Expect

A total collapse could be triggered may be triggered by a multitude of various events, such as a financial crisis (such as what's currently unfolding in both America and Europe), an external trade shock, an adverse supply shock or the bursting of an economic bubble, and may be also brought about suddenly by way of a natural disaster or epidemic (Ebola comes to mind). 

However we happen to arrive there, the results are the same, social chaos, civil unrest, a breakdown of law and order, and in the event of a catastrophic hard collapse, military intervention and the emrgence of a new [NWO]() type totalitarian reigime enforcing martial law.

 and order resulting in anarchy. (examples)
 
A pessimistic scenario of future events includes a banking crisis  leading to hyperinflation and a collapse of the economy.

This is the way our [capitalist economy is geared](), so when the current economy is abolished wealth will be resynchronised with those holding all the power, and the cycle can continue as they see fit.

## Preparedness

In the event of a total collapse the skills deemed important in our modern world will cease to be relevant. Practical survival skills will be essential, and a certain level of preparedness will be a massive advantage.

Ask yourself, what would you do if the grid stopped functioning?

* Where would you get food?
* Where would you go?
* How would you be self-sufficient?
* How would you protect yourself and your loved ones?
* Do you have the practical skills to rebuild after a collapse?

If you answered even one of those questions in the positive, then you're doing better than most.

One should have a working knowledge of:

* Your local geography
* Natural food sources
* Food storage
* Water collection (?)
* Starting a fire
* Building a basic shelter
* Martial self-defence including firearms

The best way to learn these skills is to disappear into the wilderness, pitting man against nature for a few days. Take a list and the beare necessities with you, and make mistakes until you get it right.

In terms of preparedness one should have all the tools necessary for survival, food supply, and somewhere safe to go in the event of disaster.

This is how you control society. Keep the masses dumb and poorly educated, make sure that people have low paying jobs that require them to live pay check to pay check, and then feed them mindless drivel as news to keep their minds off of real issues. Because it's hard for society to organize and fight tyranny when each day is a struggle to eat.


Int he case of a total system collapse, on of the first things to stop will be supermarket deliveries. In Australia ... trade agreements ...
Three square emans from anarchy ...

Store enough food for your immediate group to survive for a minimum of three months. Brown rice(storage, survival suration?) is a safe bet, as well as long life canned food and astronout/army meals. Also keep some salt, and a water filter with enough replacable elements to keep you out of trouble.

You won'twant to live on rice forever, so your aim will be to setup, or have access to, a garden as soon as possible.

It's a good idea to keep enough seeds to start a garden of your own, or if you get caught out then find a produce farm as soon as possible ad offer your servbices. Farm will fast become the most important places on the planet, and will be in need of extra staff to meet the extra demand, and security from looters.

It is therefore prudent to be prepared and educate yourself in the event that such disasters may come to pass.

## What Does It Look Like?

A pessimistic scenario of future events includes a banking crisis, followed by a
government bailout and the eventual nationali­zation of all banks. The
final cost is staggering and is paid with money created by the Federal Reserve.
It is passed on to the public in the form of inflation.

Further inflation is caused by the continual expansion of welfare programs, socialized
medicine, entitlement programs, and interest on the national debt. The dollar is finally
abandoned as the de facto currency of the world. Trillions of dollars are
sent back to the United States by foreign investors to be converted as
quickly as possible into tangible assets. That causes even greater
inflation than before. So massive is the inflationary pressure that
industry and commerce come to a halt. Barter becomes the means of
exchange. America takes her place among the depressed nations of
South America, Africa, and Asia—mired together in economic equality.

domestic violence, 

, a new global currency, the arrival of U.N. "Peacekeeping" forces, and a new totalitarian regime enforcing high-tech feudalism.


We have already seen recent

<!--
But this time, the programs begin to take on an international flavor. The American dollar is replaced by a new UN money, and the Federal Reserve System becomes a branch operation of the IMF/World Bank.
-->

<!--
Politicians seize upon the opportunity and offer bold reforms. The reforms are more of exactly what caused the problem in the first place: expanded governmental power, new regulatory agencies, and more restrictions on freedom. 

The failed currency will be replaced a new one designed so that electronic transfers will gradually replace cash and checking accounts. This permits government agencies to monitor the financial activities of every person. A machine-readable ID card is used for that purpose. If an individual is red flagged by any government agency, the card does not clear, and he is cut off from all economic transactions and travel. It is the ultimate control.

Increasing violence in the streets from revolutionary movements and ethnic clashes provide the government with an excuse for martial law. The public is happy to see "Peacekeepers" checking ID cards. The police-state arrives in the name of public safety.

Eventually all private dwellings are taken over by the government as a result of bailing out the home-mortgage industry. Rental property is also taken, as former landlords are unable to pay property taxes. People are allowed to live in these dwellings at reasonable cost, or no cost at all. It gradually becomes clear, however, that the government is now the owner of all homes and apartments. People are living in them only at the pleasure of the government. They can be reassigned at any time.

Wages and prices are controlled. Dissidents are placed into work armies. There are no more autos except for the ruling elite. Public transportation is provided for the masses, and those with limited skills live in government housing within walking distance of their assigned jobs. Men have been reduced to the level of serfs who are subservient to their masters. Their condition of life can only be described as high-tech feudalism.

There is no certainty that the future will unfold in exactly that manner, because there are too many variables. For example, if we had assumed that there will not be a banking crisis, then our journey would be different. We would not see long lines of depositors or panic-buying in the stores or closing of the stock market. But we would still witness the same scenes of despair in the more distant future. We merely would have traveled a different path of events to get there. That is because the forces driving our society into global totalitarianism would not have changed one iota. We still would have the doomsday mechanisms at work. We would have the CFR in control of the power centers of government and the media. We would have an electorate which is unaware of what is being done to them and, therefore, unable to resist. Through environmental and economic treaties and through military disarmament to the UN, we would witness the same emergence of a world central bank, a world government, and a world army to, enforce its dictates. Inflation and wage/price controls would have progressed more or less the same, driving consumer goods out of existence and mmen into bondage. Instead of moving toward The New World Order in a series of economic spasms, we merely would have traveled a less violent path and arrived at exactly the same destination.

* **Travel Restrictions** This will begin with restrictions on foreign travel, including suspension/removal of passports. (This has begun in a small way in both the EU and US.) Later, travel restrictions will be extended within the boundaries of countries (highway checkpoints, etc.)

* **Confiscation of wealth** The EU has instituted the confiscation of bank accounts, which can be expected to become an international form of governmental theft. This does not automatically mean that other assets, such as precious metals and real estate will also be confiscated, but it does mean that the barrier for confiscation has been eliminated. There is therefore no reason to assume that any asset is safe from any government that approves theft through bail-ins.

* **Food Shortages** The food industry operates on very small profit margins and survives only as a result of quick payment of invoices. With dramatic inflation, marginal businesses (suppliers, wholesalers, and retailers) will fall by the wayside. The percentage of failing businesses will be dependent upon the duration and severity of the inflationary trend.

* **Squatters Rebellions** A dramatic increase in the number of home and business foreclosures will result in homelessness for anyone whose debt exceeds his ability to pay—even those who presently appear to be well-off. As numbers rise significantly, a new homeless class will be created amongst the former middle class. As they become more numerous, large scale ownership of property may give way to large scale “possession” of property.

* **Riots** These will likely happen spontaneously due to the above conditions, but if not, governments will create them to justify their desire for greater control of the masses.

* **Martial Law** Martial Law and may be initially termed as EPP (Emergency Police Protection). The US has already prepared for this, with the passing of the 2012 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which many interpret as declaring the US to be a “battlefield.” The NDAA allows the suspension of habeas corpus, indefinite detention, and the assumption that any resident may be considered an enemy combatant. Similar legislation may be expected in other countries that perceive martial law as a solution to civil unrest.
